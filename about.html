<div class="about">Catering Inspired by California's Bounty
Voted one of the top catering businesses in the San Joaquin Valley area, The Painted Table has been creating unique and delicious food combinations for weddings, anniversaries, corporate gatherings, and special occasions throughout the Central Valley and Central Coast. Co-owners and personal chefs Rodney Hansen and Jeromie Garza, have deep roots in the culture of California's agricultural heartland.
Rodney hails from a family of almond and grape farmers. Committed to their Danish traditions, they stopped every day, between 10 AM and 3 PM, to relax with family and enjoy coffee, tea, fresh-squeezed juice, and pastries.
These family traditions helped Rod develop his passion for cooking using locally-grown produce and ingredients. He attended the School of Culinary Arts at the Art Institute of Seattle where he earned a degree in both Pastry and Culinary Arts. After graduating, he worked at the Culinary Institute's West Coast Campus, Greystone, in St. Helena, California. Rod also worked for the Sorrento Hotel in Seattle, Washington as well as for Dilettante Chocolate, as a pastry chef.
While Jeromie also has a love for the culinary arts, his path to the catering business took a different route. He spent many years in the dental field developing his customer service and marketing skills. He met Rod through work and learned everything about Culinary Arts from him. With their combined skills the two decided to open Magical Cakes in Visalia.
In 2008, Rod and Jeromie created The Painted Table. What started as a personal chef service, has quickly grown into a successful catering business. Clients have come to appreciate their signature dishes that are visually appealing and simply delicious.
Rod says their attention to detail makes them stand out in the catering community. The Painted Table offers unique options to its client that can't be found elsewhere. They will customize a menu to meet the specific needs of their clients, using fresh, locally grown, seasonal fruits and vegetables. Their table settings are so visually appealing that it looks like a work of art â€“ hence the name, The Painted Table.
Although they moved to the beautifully restored Daily Planet, The Painted Table is mainly an off-site catering operation, traveling throughout Central California and as far as Los Angeles or San Francisco to cater special events.
Rod and Jeromie pride themselves in making every occasion's menu a delicious work of art. All clients are treated with the utmost respect and care. Consultations are set up at either the Daily Planet or the event location to go over menu options as well as secure the date. Once a client has secured their date and made their deposit, they can set up a menu tasting.
If at all possible, they prefer to book events 6 months in advance, especially during the peak seasons during the holidays and summer, the earlier the better.
Rod and Jeromie love what they do and it shows in the service they provide. In a few short years, they have quickly become the go-to caterers for the client who wishes to create a memorable event for their guests, with amazing culinary creations that simply cannot be found with any other caterer.></div>
